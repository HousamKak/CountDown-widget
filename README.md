# CountDown-widget
This is a countdown app for PC to help me focus on working better and manage time allocations effectively during work. I only specify how much time I want to spend and the countdown starts. Unlike using my phone's timer, the whole idea behind this app is to have a big timer in front of my face, clearly indicating how much time I have left to be spending on each task. I wanted a prominent floating timer in front of me, separate from a browser's tab or my phone.

The code has been written in the my_countdown.py. All other files have been generated by the pyinstaller library.
